### 1 | Penguin Species Analysis
**Code:** [Penguin_Species_Analysis](https://github.com/MichaelRommm/DATA_ANALYST_PORTFOLIO/blob/af88fcdb23675f5063523c1353c21154db25c65a/R/Penguin%20Species%20Analysis.R)  

**Goal:** Analyze and visualize penguin species data to explore physical traits and species distribution across islands.

**Description:** This project uses the Palmer Penguins dataset to conduct exploratory data analysis and create visualizations that highlight differences in body mass, flipper length, and bill size among penguin species. The project aims to understand how these traits vary across species and their distribution on different islands.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, working with categorical and numerical data.

**Technology:** R, dplyr, ggplot2, GGally, visdat.

**Results:** The project features several [visualizations](https://github.com/MichaelRommm/DATA_ANALYST_PORTFOLIO/tree/af88fcdb23675f5063523c1353c21154db25c65a/R/output_visualizations):
- **Species Distribution by Island:** A bar plot showing the distribution of penguin species across different islands.
- **Body Mass vs. Flipper Length:** Scatterplots illustrating the relationship between body mass and flipper length, differentiated by species and sex.
- **Bill Length Comparison:** Jitter plots comparing bill length across species.
- **Flipper Length Histogram:** A histogram visualizing the distribution of flipper lengths by species.

These visualizations provide insights into the physical characteristics of penguin species and their geographical distribution, contributing to ecological and biological studies.
